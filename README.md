## Blockchain
* I chose Arbitrum because Ethereum is more "expensive" even if we're on devnet and Arbitrum is faster because it's an ETH L2 | And since it's on devnet I use the Sepolia Arbitrum network so Arbitrum's Devnet
* I use ERC-20 because it's the standard on EVM chains
* I use REMIX for testing because it's much easier and intuitive | Foundry for deploy + dev
